# Task-List

Developed this task list with vanilla javascript and a little bit of html, css. 
This is the the first project that I developed after just 3 days into Javascript. Got familiar
with the basic concepts as well. 

**Functionalities**

User can add tasks and also filter through them. On demand the user can also remove tasks separately and as well as individually.
The browser saves up tasks in the local storage so even after reloading the page, no data is lost.

**What did I learn?**

This is the first time I got to know about the usage of event listeners and functions in depth. Had a interesting journey throughout the whole project.
I got to sharpen my css skills as beacause one of my priorities was to make the web app responsive. One more thing to add is that I am really fond of the services offered by the 
Local Storage.
From then on I knew that there is no obstacle strong enough to stop me from mastering Web Development.
