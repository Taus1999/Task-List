# Task-List

Developed this task list with vanilla javascript and a little bit of html, css. 
This is the the first project that I developed after just 3 days into Javascript. Got familiar
with the basic concepts as well. 

**Functionalities**

User can add tasks and also filter through them. On demand the user can also remove tasks separately and as well as individually.

**What did I learn?**

This is the first time I got to know about the usage of event listeners and functions in depth. Had a interesting journey throughout the whole project.
I got to sharpen my css skills as beacause one of my priorities was to make the web app responsive.
From then on I knew that there is no obstacle strong enough to stop me from mastering Web Development.
